# digit-recognition
This is a handwritten digit recognition/classification model using the KNearestNeighbours algorithm.
The code is commented on, so most of the logic is explained there. The input is a 28x28 black-and-white image of a handwritten digit that is converted into an array of arrays(as provided by the MNIST dataset). I flattened the grid into a 1D array to make things easier for myself.
